# Game-of-life
John Conway's Game Of Life

Repository includes:
- Dynamically-lined library (gol.c)
- Function header file (gol.h) 
- Command-line program (gameoflife.c)
- Build system (Makefile) 

By default, the program will run assuming 5 generations, with cells on
the border outside the grid staying permanently dead.
